# citeproc-orgref

Render [org-ref](https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref) bibliographic references
in CSL styles using
[citeproc-el](https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el).

## Requirements and dependencies

`citeproc-orgref` requires Emacs 25.1 or later and depends on
[citeproc-el](https://github.com/andras-simonyi/citeproc-el), which must be
installed before installing it.

## Installation

Hopefully, `citeproc-orgref` will be available as a [MELPA](https://melpa.org)
package in the near future but until then the recommended method of installation
is to download the latest release as a package from this link, and install it
using the `package-install-file` Emacs command.

## Setup

Add the following line to your `.emacs` or  `init.el` file:

```el
(citeproc-orgref-setup)
```
